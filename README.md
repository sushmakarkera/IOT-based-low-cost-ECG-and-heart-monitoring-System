Working:

ECG Sensor: Connect an ECG sensor to the ESP32 to capture electrical signals from the heart.

Signal Processing: Use the ESP32 to process the raw ECG signals. You may need to filter, amplify, and digitize the signals for further analysis.

Voltage analysis: Analyze the processed signals to calculate and compare the voltage values.

Display on LCD: Use the ESP32 to send the heart rate information to the LCD for real-time display. The LCD can show whether the heart condition is good or bad based on predefined thresholds or algorithms.

User Interface: Implement user interaction via buttons or a touchscreen if needed. Users may want to start/stop monitoring or view historical data.

Communication: Optionally, you can add features to send data to a remote server or a mobile app for more comphrensive monitoring.

Algorithm:

STEP1:Initialization

Include Libraries: Include the LiquidCrystal, WiFi, and ThingSpeak libraries.

STEP2:Create Objects

Create a LiquidCrystal object for the LCD.

Declare variables for WiFi credentials, ThingSpeak channel information, and a WiFi client.

STEP3:Setup Function:

Serial and LCD Initialization:

Begin serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.

Initialize the LCD with its specific pins.

STEP4:Leads Off Detection Setup:

Set pin 15 as INPUT for leads off detection (LO +).

Set pin 21 as INPUT for leads off detection (LO -).

STEP5:WiFi Connection:

Connect to the WiFi network using the provided SSID and password.

ThingSpeak Initialization:

Initialize ThingSpeak communication using the ThingSpeak library and the WiFi client.

STEP6:Loop Function:

Analog Sensor Reading:

Read the analog value from pin A0 using analogRead().

STEP7:LCD Display:

Clear the LCD display.

Check for leads off condition:

If leads off is detected (digitalRead on pins 15 or 21 is 1), handle the condition as needed.

If leads are on:

Display "Analog: " and the analog value on the LCD.

Display "Health: Good" if the analog value is between 500 and 3000; otherwise, display "Health: Bad."

STEP8:Serial Output:

Print the analog value to the Serial Monitor.

ThingSpeak Data Sending:

Set ThingSpeak fields with the analog value and timestamp.

Send the data to ThingSpeak using ThingSpeak.writeFields().

STEP9:Success/Failure Message:

If the response code from ThingSpeak is 200, print "Data sent to ThingSpeak successfully" to the Serial Monitor.

If the response code is not 200, print "Failed to send data to ThingSpeak" to the Serial Monitor.

STEP10:Delay:

Introduce a delay of 1000 milliseconds to prevent saturation of LCD and Serial data.

STEP11:Repeat:

Loop back to step 7 and repeat the process.
